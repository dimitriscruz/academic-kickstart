# Biography

I am a Research Staff Member in the Storage Systems Research group at IBM Research in Almaden. Prior to that I worked on resource management and scheduling at VMware. In 2014, I completed my Ph.D. focusing on flash storage and predictable performance. I was a member of the Systems Research Lab at the Department of Computer Science, University of California, Santa Cruz. Prior to my Ph.D. studies, in 2008, I received a Master in Mathematics (M.Math) from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.

My current research is around data storage and management with an emphasis on cloud-native environments.
